This circuit is partial support for generating data-acquisition triggers at user
specified motor positions.  It's intended to work with tablePSOFly_ISR.db, and
to be driven by encoderFly.db and encoderFlyCustom.db.

This circuit expects as input a series of pulses at regular position intervals
from a motor or encoder.  For example, we might use the step-pulse output of a
motor as the "PSO" input to this circuit.  Or, we might use encoderFly.db with
the SG_encoderFly.cfg circuit (in a separate softGlue instance) to read encoder
pulses and generate triggers every Nth encoder pulse, and use that as our "PSO"
input.

We also expect as input an array of the numbers of input pulses between the
pulses we will generate.
