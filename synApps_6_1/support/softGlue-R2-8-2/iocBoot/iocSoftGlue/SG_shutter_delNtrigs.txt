This circuit produces a shutter signal, followed after a delay by N trigger
signals:


userStart       _____|---?...

shutter         _____|-----------------------|______

trigEnable      _________|-------------------|______

trigger         _________|---|___|---|___|---|______

time                 0   1   2   3

time(0,1) delay from userStart to first trigger
time(1,2) ON time of trigger pulses
time(2,3) OFF time of trigger pulses

MUX2-1

selects manual or hardwired operation.

DFF-4

produces 'shutter' on the rising edge of 'start'.  'shutter*' enables DnCntr-4
to begin counting the time delay from shutter on to the first trigger.  After
the rising edge of 'start', we don't care what that signal does.

DnCntr-4

After PRESET clock pulses, produces 'delayedStart', a pulse that sets
'trigEnable' (DFF-3) and 'trigger' (DFF-2, via OR-4).  'trigger*' rescinds
DnCntr-1's LOAD input, allowing it to begin counting the trigger ON time.

DnCntr-1

Begins counting when 'trigger' goes high, and produces 'trigEnd' PRESET clock
ticks later.  'trigEnd' loads DnCntr-2, and clears 'trigger' (DFF-2).

DnCntr-2

Begins counting when 'trigEnable' goes high, but it won't finish (won't roll all
the way around from 0, backwards again to 0) before it gets loaded with PRESET
by 'trigEnd'.  After this load, it counts down to zero to implement the trigger
OFF time, producing 'trigNext'.  'trigNext sets 'trigger' (DFF-2, via OR-4).

DnCntr-3

Counts trigger pulses.  When 'trigEnable' goes true, LOAD is rescinded, allowing
the counter to count while 'trigEnd' is high.  'trigEnd' (DnCntr-1) stays high
for only one clock tick, so each trigger decrements DnCntr-3 by one.
