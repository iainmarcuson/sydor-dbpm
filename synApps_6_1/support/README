Note that the build location has changed from previous versions of synApps.
Now, you run make in support, and it references configure/RELEASE.
The directory, config, no longer exists.

See below if you are installing synApps for the first time and need some advice.

==============================================================================
        SITE CONFIGURATION
==============================================================================
Edit the following for your site:

configure/CONFIG_SITE

        - Set the values of variables to indicate what resources your system
        has.  The synApps build has a limited ability to adjust itself to
        accommodate different system configurations.
        

configure/RELEASE
configure/RELEASE.win32-x86 (for win32-x86 only)

        - Specify paths to EPICS base and to modules. After modifying this file,
        run "make release" in support to propagate changes to all module RELEASE
        files.  (For win32-x86, run "make -f Makefile.win32-x86 release".)

Makefile
Makefile.win32-x86 (for win32-x86 only)
        - To remove modules from the build, 
	  delete or comment out the module in the
	  <synApps>/configure/RELEASE file; not in the Makefile
	- Select modules to build.
 	  Add/delete support modules by adding/deleting
 	  '#' to the two entries for each support module;
 	  	  SUPPORT_DIRS += $(module)
 	  	  RELEASE_FILES += $(module)/configure/RELEASE

To build synApps:
        set EPICS_HOST_ARCH appropriately (e.g., solaris-sparc)
        make release
        make

NOTE that 'make' implies GNU make throughout this file.

To rebuild synApps:
        set EPICS_HOST_ARCH appropriately
        make release
        make clean uninstall
        make

"make release" ensures that all the modules have consistent paths in
their RELEASE files.


==============================================================================
After adding a module
1) edit support/configure/RELEASE
2) edit support/Makefile
3) run "make release" in support
4) run "make rebuild" in any module that uses the new module

        ADVICE FOR FIRST-TIME INSTALLATION
==============================================================================

Assumes
-------

* You have defined EPICS_HOST_ARCH
* You have already installed EPICS base
* You already have the synApps source code directory (includes this file)

Configure synApps for building
------------------------------

* change directory to <synApps>/support
  All commands are run from this directory unless otherwise directed

* edit configure/RELEASE
  + adjust the value of EPICS_BASE
  + adjust the value of SUPPORT
  + comment out definitions of any modules you will not build
    (consult the Makefile to identify dependencies between modules)
  
  .. note:: Do not select/remove the modules by editing Makefile, 
     other problems will result if you do try this.
  
* run this command to copy configure/RELEASE as needed to all chosen modules::

    make release

* If building areaDetector, consider editing areaDetector/configure/CONFIG_SITE
  to comment out all the detectors you will not build.  Instructions
  are provided in that file.

* edit xxx/configure/RELEASE to match selected module 
  definitions in configure/RELEASE

Build synApps
-------------

* build synApps with these commands::

    make clean uninstall
    make
