<h2 align="center">Release 2-0-0</h2>

<p>
  This release adds support for the Yokogawa GM10 Digital Acquisition
  System.  Support is included for all modules, except for the PID one
  GX90UT-02-11.  It does not allow for the chaining of expansion
  units.
</p>

<h2 align="center">Release 1-0-0</h2>

<p>
  This is the first release of the synApps Yokogawa_DAS module, where
  DAS stands for Data Acquisition Systems.  There are two models that
  are to be supported, being the older MW100 and the newer GM10.
  Currently, only the MW100 is supported by this module.
</p>

<p>
  The support was developed using EPICS base 3.14.12, but earlier 3.14
  releases should work.
