New Features added to the SR830 EPICS support:
 - 4 channels DAC output
 - 4 channels 16-bit ADC input
 - All front-panel modes supported for channels 1 and 2.
 - Added support for filter selection, output selection, expand and ratio.
 - User-controllable fast and slow read loops, Fast for readings, Slow for parameters.


To run the SR830 with EPICS (RS232):
====================================

RS232 Comms:
  Baud: 9600
     - The device can run at 19.2K, I tested at 9600.
  Parity: No
     - The device can be set to Odd, Even, or No Parity.
  Stop bits: 2
  Data bits: 8
  Handshaking: No
  inputEos: CR
  outputEos: CR

Cable:
  db9 DTE   SR830 db25
  -------   ----------
     3         2
     2         3
     5         7

Loading the databases, for example:
  # Stanford SR830 Lock-in Amp
  dbLoadRecords("$(IP)/ipApp/Db/SR830.vdb","P=xyz:,N=1,PORT=serial9")
  dbLoadRecords("$(IP)/ipApp/Db/SR830.vdb","P=xyz:,N=2,PORT=serial10")
  dbLoadRecords("$(IP)/ipApp/Db/SR830.vdb","P=xyx:,N=3,PORT=serial11")

StreamDevice:
  SR830.proto must be in "STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH"

Autosave:
  SR830_settings.req  (can be used with "configMenu" to save instrument setups)

The arguments for the medm display are simply:
  P=xyz:, N=1

Notes:
While the "ERROR" light in the front panel's "INTERFACE" section is blinking,
the SR830 will not respond to RS232 commands.  One way to clear the error
condition is to power cycle the unit.
