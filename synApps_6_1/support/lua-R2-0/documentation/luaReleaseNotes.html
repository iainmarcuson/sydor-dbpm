<h1 align="center">lua Release Notes</h1>

<h2 align="center">Release 2-0</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>"iocsh" library now available for any version of base
<li><p>Calls to the "iocsh" library can omit the library name while within
the luash interpreter, this makes the luash almost fully backwards compatible
with iocsh scripts. The only problems come from comments (due to "#" being a
command in lua) and macros being different than global variables.
<li><p>Better error handling in "asyn" library
<li><p>lua Script file location now allows full paths
<li><p>loadRegistered function automatically triggered
and no longer needed for lua startup scripts
<li><p>Lua static library registration now setup to work with standard
lua "require" functionality
<li><p>'asyn' lua library function "port" changed to "client" to better
represent that it is creating an asynOctetClient not an asynPortDriver.
InTerminator and OutTerminator changed to member fields rather than
get/set functions.
<li><p>'asyn' lua library new function "driver" creates an object representing
an asynPortDriver. Allows you to get/set the value of parameters in the paramList
and trigger the read and write functions of parameters.
<li><p>Parameters supplied in luaRecord CODE field and macros provided to
luaSpawn are now evaluated using a lua sandbox environment rather than a 
custom parser.
